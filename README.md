# Hospital_Allocation_Made_Easy

Assignment1 Advanced Programming 

A command line app in Java to allot hospitals to patients in a relief camp based on the number of beds available in each hospital. The app takes in the details of the patient and number of recovery days for a user as input. The users with a more serious condition(wrt to oxygen levels and respiratory levels) are alloted beds in the hospitals first(depending on the number of hospital beds and condition of the hospital). It also provides a visualisation of the availability status  of hospitals and one can add more hospitals to the list.

The app keeps running until there are no patients left in the relief camp.
